# RNA‑seq Processing Pipeline (Internship Project)
This repository contains the shell, R, and Jupyter scripts developed during my internship to process RNA‑seq data on a high‑performance computing cluster and perform downstream statistical and functional analyses in R and Python. Raw sequencing reads are not included due to confidentiality and storage constraints; instead, the repository focuses on a reproducible pipeline, including differential expression (DESeq2), visualization, GO enrichment, GSEA, and selected non‑sensitive figures, together with instructions to generate intermediate files and summary results from accessible input tables.

## Objectives
The goal of this pipeline is to:
- Perform quality control and trimming of RNA-seq data.
- Align reads to a reference genome and generate count tables.
- Run differential expression and basic exploratory analyses.
- Run functional analyses.

For confidentiality and storage reasons, this repository only includes the custom scripts developed during the internship and example configuration files, but not the original data. Intermediate files can be regenerated by running the scripts in the indicated order and adjusting paths and parameters to your environment.​
